Renderer-service-upnp is a middleware component.  It is designed to be
launched by d-Bus activation when needed.  It automatically shuts down
when the last of its clients quits or releases its connection.

Renderer-service-upnp currently connects to the d-Bus session bus,
although this may change in the future.  It exposes two different
types of objects:

1. A manager object.  There is only ever a single instance of this
object.  It can be used to retrieve a list of the DMRs on the local
area network.  It is also used to perform certain server independent
tasks.

2. Server objects.  One separate object is exposed for each DMR
available on the LAN.  These objects expose interfaces that allow
clients to retrieve information about the renderers, to manipulate
them and to push content to them.

The remainder of this document will describe the two d-Bus objects
listed above and the interfaces they support.


The Manager Object:
-------------------

There is only ever a single instance of this object.  The manager
object exposes a single d-Bus interface,
com.intel.RendererServiceUPnP.Manager.


com.intel.RendererServiceUPnP.Manager
---------------------------------

Methods:
----------

The interface com.intel.RendererServiceUPnP.Manager contains 3
methods.  Descriptions of each of these methods along with their d-Bus
signatures are given below.

GetServers() -> ao

GetServers takes no parameters and returns an array of d-Bus object
paths.  Each of these paths reference a d-Bus object that represents a
single DMR.

GetVersion() -> s

Returns the version number of renderer-service-upnp

Release()

Indicates to renderer-service-upnp that a client is no longer
interested in its services.  Internally, renderer-service-upnp
maintains a reference count.  This reference count is increased when a
new client connects.  It is decreased when a client quits.  When the
reference count reaches 0, renderer-service-upnp exits.  A call to
Release also decreases the reference count.  Clients should call this
method if they intend to keep running but they have no immediate plans
to invoke any of renderer-service-upnp's methods.  This allows
renderer-service-upnp to quit, freeing up system resources.


Signals:
---------

The com.intel.RendererServiceUPnP.Manager interface also exposes two
signals.

FoundServer(o)

Is generated whenever a new DMR is detected on the local area network.
The signal contains the path of the newly discovered server.

LostServer(o)

Is generated whenever a DMR is shutdown.  The signal contains the path
of the server which has just been shutdown.


The Server Objects:
------------------

Renderer-service-upnp exposes a separate d-Bus object for each DMR it
detects on the LAN.  These objects serve three purposes.

1. They allow the client to retrieve information about the DMR, such
as its name, the URL of its icon, its manufacturer, the currently
playing content, etc.

2. They allow the client to manipulate the DMR, i.e., to play a given
URL, to play, pause and stop, etc.

3. They can be used to implement two box push.

Each server object exposes three separate interfaces:
org.mpris.MediaPlayer2, org.mpris.MediaPlayer2.Player and
com.intel.RendererServiceUPnP.PushHost.


org.mpris.MediaPlayer2
----------------------

This interface is part of the MPRIS standard and is documented in the
MRPIS D-Bus Interface Specification document [1].  As the interface is
well described in this document, this section will focus on the
peculiarities of renderer-service-upnp's implementation of this
interface rather than the interface itself.

The main points of interest are:

- The methods Raise and Quit are implemented but they do nothing.  The
  CanRaise and CanQuit properties necessarily return false.

- The property HasTrackList is always set to false.  This is because
  TrackLists are not yet implemented.  Hopefully, this will change in
  the future.

- The property CanSetFullscreen is always set to false and Fullscreen
  is not implemented.

- The DesktopEntry is not implemented.

In addition to these restrictions, renderer-service-upnp's
implementation of org.mpris.MediaPlayer2 exposes one extra property
that is not part of the MRPIS2 specification.  The property is called,
ProtocolInfo and its details are given in the table below.

|---------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|     Name        | Type | m/o* |              Description                  |
|---------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| ProtocolInfo    |  s   |   m  | A string that identifies all of the file  |
|                 |      |      | formats and network protocol combinations |
|                 |      |      | that the renderer supports.               |
|---------------------------------------------------------------------------|

(* where m/o indicates whether the property is optional or mandatory )

The idea behind the ProtocolInfo property is a little complicated and
requires further discussion.  The Protocol info field is a comma
separated list of protocol info values.  Each protocol info value
consists of 4 fields separated by colons.  Unfortunately, the format
is too complex to describe in this document.  The reader is referred
to the UPnP Connection Manager Service Template document (2) and the
DLNA Guidelines (3) where it is described extensively.  However, an
example protocol info value is presented below, to give the reader an
idea of what such a string might look like.

"http-get:*:audio/mp4:DLNA.ORG_PN=AMR_WBplus,
http-get:*:image/jpeg:DLNA.ORG_PN=JPEG_MED"

The ProtocolInfo property identifies the types of URLs the renderer is
capable of playing.  The example value given above indicates that the
renderer is capable of retrieving (via HTTP) and playing/displaying
audio MP4 and JPEG files.  Now the astute among you might notice that
the information provided by the ProtocolInfo property is already
available via the standard MPRIS SupportedMimeTypes and
SupportedUriSchemes properties.  This is true, however ProtocolInfo is
still useful as its value is specifically formatted to make it easy to
write a certain type of application called a Digital Media Controller
(DMC).

When you write a DMC you instruct a DMR to play a media file exposed
by a Digital Media Server (DMS).  DMSs often publish the same piece of
media content in a number of formats, exposing a separate URL for each
format.  The DMC can use the ProtocolInfo of his chosen renderer to
determine which of the many formats is most suitable for the renderer
and having done this to determine which URL to use.  If the DMC uses
media-service-upnp to browse the contents of DMSs, it can achieve this
simply by identifying the media-service-upnp d-Bus object of the file
it wishes to play, and then invoking this object's
GetCompatibleResource method, passing the renderer's ProtocolInfo
string as a parameter.  This method will then return the most suitable
URL for the renderer.


org.mpris.MediaPlayer2.Player
-----------------------------

Like org.mpris.MediaPlayer2, org.mpris.MediaPlayer2.Player is a
standard MPRIS2 interface and is already documented in the MRPIS2
specification.  Consequently, this section will only describe the
peculiarities of renderer-service-upnp's implementation of this
interface.  The main points of interest are noted below:

- The LoopStatus property is not implemented.

- The Shuffle property is not implemented.

- The Rate property is currently read only.  This will change in the future.

- The Volume property is read only.  This will change in the future.

- The TransportPlaySpeeds property is not part of MPRIS specification: it
  is an array of strings, representing the range of play speeds supported by
  the renderer.  Clients can use this information to determine acceptable
  values to assign to the Rate property.

- The Seek signal is not implemented yet.

- The first parameter to SetPosition is ignored, and any valid d-Bus
  path can be specified as its value.

- PropertiesChanged signals are emitted via the org.freedesktop.DBus.Properties
  interface of a server object instance when org.mpris.MediaPlayer2.Player
  interface properties value change.

org.mpris.MediaPlayer2.TrackList and org.mpris.MediaPlayer2.Playlists
---------------------------------------------------------------------
Are not yet implemented.


com.intel.RendererServiceUPnP.PushHost
---------------------------------------

DMRs participate in two different DLNA use cases.  3 Box System and 2
Box Push.  In the 3 Box System a DMC instructs a DMR to play a URL
hosted by a DMS.  In 2 Box Push, an application pushes content it has
created or downloaded directly to a renderer.  In 2 Box Push the DMS
is not involved at all and this presents a problem as DMRs do not
really support the concept of Push.  Rather than pushing files to a
DMR, the client passes it a URL and then instructs the DMR to pull the
content from the URL.  For this to work, a web server must be running
somewhere to host the URL.  In the 3 Box System the role of the web
server is played by the DMS.  Unfortunately, as we have seen, in 2 Box
Push there is no DMS.  So who is to host the content to be pushed?

Conceptually, each application that wishes to push a file to a DMR
could start its own web server on which it could temporarily host the
file to be pushed.  However, this is complicated for application
developers and also wasteful of system resources.  Potentially, every
application that can create of download content can push this content
to DMRs.  As, these applications can legitimately run simultaneously
having them run their own web servers would consume unnecessary system
resources.

Renderer-service-upnp solves these problems by providing both a web
server and simple APIs that can be used by clients to host files on
this server.  As only one instance of renderer-service-upnp runs at
any one time (well currently only one can run per user session) we
avoid the proliferation of web servers.  These push APIs are provided
by the com.intel.RendererServiceUPnP.PushHost interface which is
implemented by all renderer server objects.

com.intel.RendererServiceUPnP.PushHost contains two methods which are
described in below.


HostFile(s path) -> s

Hosts a file on renderer-service-upnp's web server.  The parameter
path should be a full path to the local file to be hosted, e.g.,
/home/user/Podcasts/pod.mp3.  The value returned is the URL of the
newly hosted file.


RemoveFile(s path)

Stops hosting the file whose full path is passed as parameter to this
function.

Renderer-service-upnp only runs a web server when files are being
hosted.  Once all clients have stopped hosting files, either by
calling RemoveFile or by exiting, renderer-service-upnp will shut down
its web server.  Actually, renderer-service-upnp may run more than one
web server if multiple DMRs are accessed over different interfaces.
When a client chooses to host a file for a given renderer,
renderer-service-upnp checks to see if a web server is already running
on the interface through which this renderer is accessible.  If it is
not it starts a new web server.  It follows that if clients try to
host multiple files for multiple renderers running on different
interfaces, renderer-service-upnp may actually run multiple servers.
However, it will only run one server per interface, and the server
will be shutdown as soon as it no longer has any files to host.
